# GraphQL quick intro

In this repo we will overview the GraphqQL and it's use

Action plan and things that we will look into:

* Why graphql?

  Read this two official docs for more: 

  * <https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html>
  * <https://relay.dev/docs/en/thinking-in-graphql>

  In short reasons are:
  
  * Maintainabilty
  * Single round trip for fetching all necessary data
  * No over-fetching

  What is the alternative? [Falcor!](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/) from Netflix

* Server GraphQL setup with help of express
* Client on React with Apollo
* Client on Angular with Apollo
* Client on Node.js

After this we can then go and deep dive the implemantaion detals... But this will be in the future!
